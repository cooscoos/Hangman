# Hangman

This is a command line interface Hangman game coded in Rust.

## How do I play this?

Download the repo, then follow instructions for your OS.

### Linux
* In terminal, navigate to `/target/release`
* run `./hangman`

### Windows

* Download a terminal application that can display colour from the Microsoft Store, e.g. [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701?hl=en-gb&gl=GB) (you can run this game with cmd but it'll look like a mess).
* Within your terminal, navigate to `\target\x86_64-pc-windows-gnu\release`
* Run`.\hangman`

### MacOS:

`¯\\_(ツ)_/¯`
